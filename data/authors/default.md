<h1>Hey there, I&apos;m Naina Razafindrabiby 👋</h1>
<p>I am a JavaScript developer, and I love designing and creating apps for the web.</p>

<h2>My short story</h2>
<p>
  Since I was small, I have been fascinated by computers. I have liked video games in
  particular and I have dreamed of working with them one day. But guess what, I have not
  created any game until now 😊.
</p>
<p>
  I came across web development later in my life and I fell in love with it. What I
  especially like about it is that you can immediately see the result of what you are doing
  and you can also play with your creativity a lot. The web is just so powerful nowadays,
  and you can pretty much do anything with it. I have decided to have my career built around
  web development.
</p>
<p>
  I have studied Software Engineering in Kampala, Uganda, and shortly after graduating, I
  got my first job as a software developer in a large software consulting company. Now I am
  working with a software startup developing web applications.
</p>
