# Hey there, I&apos;m Naina Razafindrabiby 👋

I am a JavaScript developer, and I love designing and creating apps for the web.

## My short story

Since I was small, I have been fascinated by computers. I have liked video games in
particular and I have dreamed of working with them one day. But guess what, I have not
created any game until now 😊.

I came across web development later in my life and I fell in love with it. What I
especially like about it is that you can immediately see the result of what you are doing
and you can also play with your creativity a lot. The web is just so powerful nowadays,
and you can pretty much do anything with it. I have decided to have my career built around
web development.

I have studied Software Engineering in Kampala, Uganda, and shortly after graduating, I
got my first job as a software developer in a large software consulting company. Now I am
working with a software startup developing web applications.
