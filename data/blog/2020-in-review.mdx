We have a couple of days left before 2020 is gone. In this post I want to share some of the things that has happened to me during the year.

## Blog

One of the goals I set this year was to create an online presence through a blog. My main motivation was to actually solidify what I already know by sharing, and also learn something new things. By writing tutorials and articles, I am forced to deeply learn about a topic and explain it to others in simple language.

In early February, I started creating my personal website where would be writing my articles. Then in March 11, I published my first article. Yes!! ðŸ˜Ž I was so happy.

I tried to write an article every week, but you know... , as what happens to many new bloggers, after just a month, my motivation kinda dried up. Around April, I paused a bit from writing and [rewrote my blog from Next.js to Gatsby](https://nainacodes.com/blog/moving-my-blog-from-next-to-gatsby). I completely redesigned my site on how it looks and feel (what you are seeing right now). I was trying to learn Gatsby at that time, so why not apply what I learn, right?

After redoing my site, I resumed writing again, writing one article every week. That pace lasted for about two months before I got busy again. But instead of giving up with what I had already started, I decided that I would write an article at least once a month.

Now I have 17 articles (including this one) written this year. Although I initially planned to write 20 articles, having 17 out of 20 is already a great achievement for me, and I will definitely continue to write more in the coming year.

## An article ranked number 1 in Google

One of my proudest achievement this year is that one of my articles ranked number 1 in Google search. It is about on how to create an accessible React modal using TypeScript.

I honestly didn't expect this to rank number 1, especially with the number of great articles already written about it. It is also one of my longest article, which was a pain to write. I still remember telling myself (at that time) to just write about something else that is shorter and simpler. Maybe if I did, I wouldn't have made this achievement. But my perseverance paid off ðŸ™‚.

Some of my other articles are also ranking well in Google. If there is one skill I truly learned this year, I think that would be SEO. I think I progressed from zero knowledge to a somehow intermediate/advance level.

## First times

The Covid-19 pandemic has indeed brought many bad things, but one good thing I got from this pandemic was that I was able to work remotely full time. I had always dreamed of working remotely, and it has finally happened. I enjoyed it, and I felt I was more productive. I had more time because I didn't have to travel to work (which takes at least an hour everyday). Of course I also faced some downsides, like feeling lonely at times and communication was sometimes harder. But overall I liked it and would love to work remotely again.

2020 is the year I blogged for the first time. It was actually a scary thought for me in the beginning. What will I write about? Will people read my articles? What if someone better than me reads my blog? All those questions crossed my mind. I'm not also that great of a writer ðŸ˜…. But after starting and continually writing, it got easier.

On a personal life, 2020 is also the year in which I attended a wedding for the first time ðŸ˜². Hmmm, still thinking how has that happened ðŸ¤”

## Things I want to learn in 2021

Here are some items I want to learn in 2021.

1. Design Patterns
2. Design Systems
3. Tailwind CSS
4. Intersection Observer API

## Conclusion

2020 is indeed not like any other year before, but it not all bad as most people say. If the pandemic left you the same, then you have missed a big opportunity to level up. I have learned many new things, and I have also tried many things I have never done before.

There is joke I have seen somewhere, saying, "What is one thing that has brought innovation to your company? Covid-19." ðŸ˜‚ I think this is true. The pandemic caused all of us to change in one way or another.

Let us hope 2021 will be better.
